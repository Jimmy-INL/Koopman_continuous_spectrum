# Koopman_continuous_spectrum
This repository outlines two computational approaches for approximating 
the continuous spectrum of the Koopman operator of dynamical systems

Method 1: using classical spectral estimation of stochastic signals from  
"Study of dynamics in post-transient flows using Koopman mode decomposition"
Physical Review Fluids 2017, by H. Arbabi and I. Mezic (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00813.pdf).

Method 2: apprximating the Koopman spectral measure using Fourier moments and Christoffel-Darboux kernel from   
"Data-driven spectral analysis of the Koopman operator"
arXiv, by M. Korda, M. Putinar and I. Mezic (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06532.pdf).
